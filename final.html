	    <h3>Number treasure hunt is a game about strategy. <br>The goal of the game is to get a higher score than your opponent by clicking on the different numbered tiles. <br>Player one moves up in down and player 2 must make their last move off player 1.  <br>Once no more legal moves can be made, it’s a free formal for the remaining number squares. <br>Who ever has the highest score by the end wins. <br>The game includes a main menu with a play game button, and an instructions button. When playing the game once all the tiles have been clicked it takes you to the win screen.<br>
